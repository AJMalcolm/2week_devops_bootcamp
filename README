### Linux commands thata also work on Bash
- Create a Directory 'mkdir name_of_the_directory'
- Go inside the Directory 'cd name_of_the_directory'
- Come out of the Directory 'cd ..' (up 1 level) or 'cd' (root directory)
- Who am I 'uname -a'
- Where am I? 'pwd'
- Create a file 'touch name_of_the_file' or 'nano file_name' you land inside the file
- Exit from nano 'ctrl x' then 'y'
- List all 'ls -a' (inc hidden files) or 'ls'
- Clear the screen 'clear'
- Print the contents of a file 'cat name_of_file'

- Delete a folder 'rm -rf name_of_the_folder'
- Delete a file 'rm name_of_the_file'
- Delete multiple files within a directory 'rm directory/*'
	- 'rm directory/* --dry-run' will return a list of what would be deleted as a result of this command.
	- 'rm -v !("file_not_to_be_deleted")' removes all but specified file

- Open Linux Task Manager 'top', 'q' to exit this mode
- Similar to above -> 'ps', 'ps aux'
- Change user to root 'sudo su', 'exit' to escape this. Allows the running of commands without the 'sudo' preface
- Print all commands entered as current user 'history'
- Check the status of a program 'systemctl status {program}'
- Stops the specified program from running 'systemctl stop {program}'
